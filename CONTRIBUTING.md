# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome AI Development!

## Adding Resources

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

### General

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Name](link) - Description.`
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions concise and accurate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

### Quality Standards

Resources should be:

- **Active**: Maintained within the last 12 months (or clearly stable/complete).
- **Documented**: Have clear documentation or explanation of use.
- **Relevant**: Directly related to AI development, compliance, or governance.
- **Accessible**: Available to use (free tier, open source, or reasonable pricing).

### Categories

When adding a new resource, place it in the most appropriate existing category. If no category fits:

1. Consider if it belongs in an existing category with slight modifications.
2. Propose a new category with at least 3 resources.
3. Discuss in an issue before creating the PR.

### Format Examples

**Tools:**

`- [Tool Name](https://example.com/) - Brief description of what it does.`

**Open Source:**

`- [Tool Name](https://github.com/org/repo) - Brief description. **Open source**.`

**Standards:**

`- [Standard Name](https://official-link.org/) - Description (Audit frequency or self-declarative).`

## Updating Resources

When updating existing resources:

- Verify the new information is accurate.
- Explain why the change is necessary in the PR description.
- If a resource is no longer maintained, suggest removal or archival.

## Removing Resources

Resources may be removed if:

- The project is abandoned (no updates for 2+ years without being stable/complete).
- The link is broken and no replacement exists.
- The resource no longer meets quality standards.
- Better alternatives exist and the list is too long.

3. Make your changes to `README.md`.
4. Commit with a clear message: `Add [Resource Name] to [Category]`.
